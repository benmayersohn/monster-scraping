Crisis Text Line provides free, 24/7 emotional support and information to people in crisis, by text. We aim to move every texter in crisis from a hot moment to a cool calm.   Crisis Text Line is growing at an incredible rate. Since launching in August of 2013, our Crisis Counselors have exchanged over 65 million messages with texters in crisis. Currently, we are exchanging 3 million messages per month and growing 8% month over month. Most of this growth is organic; as we scale, our rate of growth is only increasing.   What this means: it's our hockey stick moment. Scaling staff and volunteers alone won\u2019t allow us to keep up with the curve. Data is one of the key tools that will help us scale our ability to move every texter from hot to cool.  Responsibilities The Data Scientist\u2019s role at Crisis Text Line is to support staff in making smarter decisions through data.  The Data Scientist\u2019s day-to-day role is to collect, store, and analyze large and fast moving data sets to inform (1) product iterations and pivots, (2) organizational strategy, (3) how CTL shares data. A successful candidate will possess strong skills in data analysis, wrangling, and visualization. Most importantly, they should have passion for data storytelling with non-technical staff. Ultimately, the Data Scientist will succeed to the the degree they can do two things: (1) \u201cnot need to be in the room;\u201d i.e., make the data self-serve and self-explanatory to non-technical staff who need data that moves at the speed of their decision-making, and (2) know when it\u2019s important to be in the room to make sure data is (a) interpreted correctly and (b) acted on. The pipeline between data and action is great storytelling. I. Reporting (40%)   Manage ad hoc reporting requests using MySQL, Python/R, and Periscope Data to support organizational strategy, product evaluation, and funding.   Curate & translate technical nuance to non-technical end users to drive behavior change.   Automate recurring reporting requests using Python/R, Periscope Data, and other BI tools.   II. Analysis (40%)   Move from \u201cwhat\u201d to \u201cwhy\u201d; identify trends and deep dive into their root causes using SQL and Python/R.    Devise metrics of success for new products and policies; in collaboration with key stakeholders, compile post launch analyses evaluating success.   Identify anomalies and opportunities for growth in relation to our Key Performance Indicators (KPIs).    III. Research (20%)   Gather research from relevant (1) organizations, (2) journals, and (3) industry.   Design A/B tests to evaluate ideas before we decide to build them as products; work closely with engineers and product managers to implement.   Collect qualitative data to understand why a product failed or met expectations (user interviews, surveys etc.).      Advanced computer skills. Experience with Python and/or R, strong knowledge of a database query language (MySQL, PostgreSQL, etc.), and experience developing compelling visualizations for non-technical users are a must.   2+ years business experience in Data Analytics or a related field. You\u2019ve developed pathways to self-serve information for non-technical staff, including dashboards, monitoring and alert systems. You understand and can explain statistics and A/B testing frameworks.   A business perspective. You believe in the pareto principle: 20% of the effort generates 80% of the value, and that is often the optimal solution. We could seek perfect answers, but it would take too long. We\u2019ve got to move quickly to save lives.   A people person. You may be an introvert or extrovert; either way, you believe the best foundation for data insights and products is face-to-face conversations with users. You\u2019re excited to get out of the \u201cdata cave\u201d to listen to staff and Crisis Counselors. You believe data teams have the skills to solve problems, but that users know the problems we need to solve.   B.S. in quantitative field, or equivalent work experience. We love people who are self-taught.   How to apply: Email your application to Jackie Weiser at jweiser@crisistextline.org with the subject line KEEP IT SIMPLE and your resume attached. Answer the following questions in the email:   What are 2 of your favorite blog posts in the last month (as it relates to this position)?   What has been the biggest data \u2018win\u2019 you\u2019ve had at an organization or personally?   What question should we ask you?   Do you have any projects on github you would like to share? Please link to them.   Applications will be reviewed on a rolling basis.   Additionally   3 weeks vacation plus you don\u2019t have to come to work on your birthday (but we\u2019ll probably bake you cookies if you do).
